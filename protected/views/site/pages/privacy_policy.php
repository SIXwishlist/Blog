As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the WeReviews Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and WeReviews Features. By visiting the Site or using any of the WeReviews Features, you consent to WeReviews’s collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.</p>
<p class="inner_contentsubheading">This policy answers the following questions:</p>
<p>1. What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?</p>
<p>2. Will we share your personal information with third parties?</p>
<p>3. What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?</p>
<p>4. What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?</p>
<p class="inner_contentsubheading">1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</p>

<p>Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You need to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the WeReviews Features.<br />We collect personal information when you subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms, questionnaires, contests or sweepstakes; purchase a product through the WeReviews Features; or receive customer or technical support.</p>
<p>We collect information from you such as your name, address, email address, telephone number and date of birth when utilizing the Site and WeReviews Features. When registering products through the Site we also collect information about your products and where you purchased your products. </p>
<p class="inner_contentsubheading"> How We Use Your Personal Information </p>
<p>The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill any product or service orders; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; administer promotions, contests and sweepstakes; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you.

We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the WeReviews Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information.</p>
<p>You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the WeReviews Features (the Analytical Data).

<p>If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other transaction involving the sale of some or all of WeReviews’s assets, user information, including personal information collected from you through your use of the WeReviews Features, could be included in the transferred assets.
